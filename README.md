# MovieRama Lite

## Highlights

### 1. **User Reaction Management**
- Users carry their own data regarding the movies they have liked or disliked, stored individually in the system.
- Movies themselves only store the **count** of likes and dislikes rather than individual user reactions, ensuring minimal computation when rendering the movie list.

### 2. **Efficient Count Updates**
- The like and dislike counts for movies are updated asynchronously using **application events**.
- When a user likes or dislikes a movie, the corresponding event is published and handled asynchronously, adding an eventual consistency. The ui itself is getting update realtime.

### 3. **Optimized for Quick Renders**
- The application is designed to **eliminate computational overhead** when retrieving the number of likes and dislikes for each movie. Since the counts are maintained independently of the usersâ€™ reaction data, this allows for **fast rendering** of movie lists.
- By pre-calculating and storing counts, race conditions are minimized, and updates to movie reactions are handled without risking conflicts when modifying the same database rows.

### 4. **Scalable and Race Condition Resistant**
- The architecture is designed to **eliminate race conditions** by preventing simultaneous updates to the same database rows. Since user reactions and movie counts are stored separately, updates can be made safely without locking issues.

## Running the Application
The application is containerized using **Docker** and can be easily run using **Docker Compose**. Follow the steps below to get the application up and running.

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system.
- Docker Compose installed.

### Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Run Docker Compose**
   The `docker-compose.yml` file will spin up two services:
    - The **Spring Boot application** container.
    - A **PostgreSQL** database container.

   To start the application, simply run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will:
    - Start the **PostgreSQL** database on port `5432`.
    - Start the **Spring Boot** application on port `8080`.

3. **Access the Application**

   Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application by navigating to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

4. **Stopping the Application**

   To stop the application and remove the containers, run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
   
5. **Troubleshooting**
  
  If the app fails to run on an amd64 machine change the image to jtsompos/lite:latest

### Docker Compose Configuration Overview

The `docker-compose.yml` defines two services:

- **App (Spring Boot)**: The Spring Boot app runs in a Docker container using your custom image. The app is configured to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
- **Postgres (Database)**: A PostgreSQL instance is set up to persist the movie and user data.

```yaml
services:
   app:
      image: jtsompos/lite:native
      container_name: movierama-lite-app
      ports:
         - "8080:8080"
      environment:
         - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/movierama
         - SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=myuser
         - SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=mypassword
      depends_on:
         - db
      networks:
         - lite
   db:
      image: 'postgres:latest'
      container_name: db
      environment:
         - 'POSTGRES_DB=movierama'
         - 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword'
         - 'POSTGRES_USER=myuser'
      ports:
         - '5432:5432'
      networks:
         - lite
networks:
   lite:
      driver: bridge
```

## Future Improvements

- **Caching**: Likes, dislikes or event whole movies could be cached for better performance
- **Pagination**: Movies could be paginated
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Authentication could be moved to a standalone system and tokens could be shared to the resource applications
- **Batch Processing**: The current asynchronous event handling system for updating likes and dislikes could be extended to support **batch updates** in the future. This would improve performance and reduce the load on the database when handling large volumes of reactions.
